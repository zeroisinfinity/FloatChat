# FloatChat – AI for ARGO Ocean Data

## What is FloatChat?
FloatChat is an **AI-powered conversational tool** that makes huge ARGO ocean datasets (temperature, salinity, currents, etc.) accessible to everyone.  
Instead of coding or parsing NetCDF files, users can simply **ask questions in natural language** and get answers, charts, or insights.

## Why Do We Need It?
- **Ocean data is critical**: for climate change, fisheries, disaster management, and coastal planning.  
- **Currently locked away**: only experts with coding/data skills can use it.  
- **FloatChat democratizes access**: students, policymakers, researchers, NGOs, even citizens can explore data easily.  

## Key Benefits
- Saves **time for researchers** → no need to manually wrangle data.  
- Helps **government & agencies** make faster, informed decisions.  
- Provides **real-world datasets** for students/educators.  
- Boosts **public awareness** on oceans and climate.
